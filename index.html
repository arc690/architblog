        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>here are my some tips to sketch:Let’s begin!
            1. Always start with the basic shapes. Draw these in lightly and add in more details as you go.

            2. Avoid smudging by placing a sheet of paper under your hand when shading. Right-handed artists should shade from left to right and left-handed artists should do the opposite.

            3. Don’t use your finger to blend! The oils from your skin will end up on your project and they can make taking away graphite in these areas difficult.

            4. Instead, use a blending stick to blend the graphite. Use a small circular motion for even blending. This will give it a more natural look.

            5. When shading, work from light to dark. Otherwise, the dark graphite could get stuck on your blending stick and mixed in with your lighter areas.

            6. Add some texture by using different mediums in your sketch like watercolor pencils. You can add water on parts and leave other parts dry.

            7. Use “H” (harder) pencils for lighter lines and “B” (softer) pencils for a darker line. More on pencil lead options here.

            8. Get a very soft look by scribbling on a scrap piece of paper with your pencil. You can then pick up the graphite with your blending stick and transfer it to your project. This way you won’t get those pencils lines in your sketch.

            9. Choose a paper with a “tooth” for added texture.

            10. The closer you hold your hand to the end (lead end) of the pencil, the more control you have.

            11. Use a photo as your reference. The nice thing about photographs is your object won’t move and the lighting won’t shift on you.

            12. Vary your line widths for a more interesting drawing.

            13. Use cross-hatching or stippling to shade for a different and unique look.

            14. Practice every single day! Whatever you’re struggling with, just keep sketching it out and you will get better.

            15. When creating 3D objects, you’ll have three different tones to pay attention to: highlights, shadows, and mid-tones. Your highlight area will be the part directly facing the light. Shadows are the area facing away from the light and mid-tones are the other area (not directly facing the light source and not directly away from the light source).

            16. When choosing a reference photo, make sure there are both light and dark areas.

            17. To achieve accurate proportion (especially when working on a portrait) use the grid system. Lay a grid over your reference photo and lightly draw a grid on your drawing paper to scale.

            18. Practice blind sketching. This is a fun technique that loosens up your drawings, like a drawing warm up. Basically, you’re drawing the subject without looking down at your sketchbook. This is just a fun way to get those creative juices flowing.

            19. Carry a sketchbook with you everywhere you go. Observe and sketch often!

            20. Draw what you see. Pay close attention to your subject matter. Really look at shapes and shadows.

            21. Always keep your outlines light. Real life objects don’t have dark lines running along the edges. However, if you’re drawing in a cartoon style, this tip doesn’t apply.

            22. Choose which details to include and which ones to leave out. It’s not necessary to include every single detail in the leaves of a tree. Think about what’s aesthetically pleasing and decide what can be left out.

            23. Add color! Bring in some colored pencils, pastels, or even watercolor paint to your work to add some color.
